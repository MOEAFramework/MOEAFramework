Objective.patch and ObjectiveClasses.patch
------------------------------------------
These patches add incomplete support for specifying the direction (minimization
or maximization) for each objective.  These changes have been abandoned for the
near-term due to challenges in its implementation.  Primarily, to ensure
consistent handling of data, the direction needs to be stored alongside the
Pareto solutions.  This can be done in two ways:

  1) Whenever reading / writing any data file, the associated problem must be
     specified as an argument; or
     
  2) Encode the direction within data files.
