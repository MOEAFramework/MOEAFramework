/**
 * Package containing the BBOB 2016 bi-objective test problems.  These problems
 * will be tested in the Workshop on Real-Parameter Black-Box Optimization
 * Benchmarking at GECCO 2016.  The authors combine various single-objective
 * functions to form the bi-objective test suite.  Each of the
 * single-objective functions has well-known problem properties, including
 * looking at the conditioning number.  Conditioning looks at the effect of
 * small changes to the function's inputs on its output.  For example, small
 * changes to a low conditioned function causes only small changes in the
 * output.
 * <p>
 * Note: this implementation does not provide all BBOB test functions.  It
 * currently only implements the 55 test functions studied in the bbob-biobj
 * suite.
