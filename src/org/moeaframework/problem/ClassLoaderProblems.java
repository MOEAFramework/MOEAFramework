/**
 * Legacy problem provider that locates problems using their fully-qualified class name.  For example:
 * <pre>
 *   ProblemFactory.getInstance().getProblem("org.moeaframework.problem.LZ.LZ1");
 * </pre>
 * There are a few limitations of this provider, including:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Problems must provide an empty constructor; and
 *   <li>A reference set can not be defined, so any analysis will need an explicit reference set
 * </ol>
 * Defining problems this way is no longer recommended.  Instead, we recommend using a
 * {@code RegisteredProblemProvider} to register new problems with this framework.
