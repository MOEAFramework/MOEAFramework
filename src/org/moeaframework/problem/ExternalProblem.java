/**
 * Evaluate solutions using an externally-defined problem.  Two modes of
 * operation are supported: standard I/O and sockets.
 * 
 * <h4>Standard I/O Mode</h4>
 * Standard I/O is the easiest mode to setup and run.  First, an executable
 * program on the computer is launched by invoking the constructor with the
 * program name (and any optional arguments):
 * <pre>
 *   new ExternalProblem("./problem.exe", "arg1", "arg2") { ... }
 * </pre>
 * Then, solutions are sent to the process on its standard input (stdin) stream,
 * and the objectives and constraints are read from its standard output (stdout)
 * stream.
 * <p>
 * The program can not use the standard I/O for any other purpose.  Programs
 * which read from or write to the standard I/O streams should instead use
 * sockets, as discussed below.
 * 
 * <h4>Socket Mode</h4>
 * Socket mode is more complicated to setup, but is more flexible and robust.
 * It has the ability to not only evaluate the problem on the host computer,
 * but can be spread across a computer network.  To use sockets, use either the
 * {@link #ExternalProblem(String, int)} or
 * {@link #ExternalProblem(InetAddress, int)} constructor.
 * 
 * <h4>C/C++ Interface</h4>
 * A C/C++ interface is provided for implementing problems.  This interface
 * supports both modes of communication, depending on which initialization
 * routine is invoked.  See the {@code moeaframework.c} and
 * {@code moeaframework.h} files in the {@code examples/} folder for details.
 * This interface conforms to the communication protocol described below.
 * <p>
 * The communication protocol consists of sending decision variables to the
 * external process, and the process responding with the objectives and
 * constraints.  The decision variables line consists of one or more variables
 * separated by whitespace and terminated by a newline. The process evaluates
 * the problem for the given variables and outputs the objectives separated by
 * whitespace and terminated by a newline. If the problem also has constraints,
 * each constraint is returned after the objectives on the same line.  The
 * process must only terminate when the end of stream is reached. In addition,
 * the process should flush the output stream to ensure the output is processed
 * immediately.
 * <p>
 * Whitespace is one or more spaces, tabs or any combination thereof. The
 * newline is either the line feed ('\n'), carriage return ('\r') or a carriage
 * return followed immediately by a line feed ("\r\n"). 
 * <p>
 * <b>It is critical that the {@link #close()} method be invoked to ensure the
 * external process is shutdown cleanly.</b>
