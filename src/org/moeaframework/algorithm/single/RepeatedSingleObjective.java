/**
 * Instantiates and runs several instances of a single objective algorithm.
 * This is intended to be used with single-objective optimizers that use
 * weighted aggregation of the objectives.  This is based on the Repeated Single
 * Objective (RSO) algorithm by E. J. Hughes [1], where he investigates running
 * many single-objective optimizers (one many) compared to running a single
 * many-objective optimizer (many once).
 * <p>
 * Be mindful of how running multiple instances affects the {@link #step()}.
 * Each step performs one iteration of each instance.  Thus, given 50 instances
 * of an algorithm with a population size of 100, then 5000 evaluations will
 * occur each step.  In [1], they decrease the population size for the single
 * objective optimizers.
