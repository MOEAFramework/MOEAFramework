/**
 * Compares solutions based on a computed aggregate fitness from the objective values.  Examples could include weighted
 * linear, weighted min-max, or vector angle distance scaling (VADS).
 * <p>
 * Implementation Note: This interface extends both the {@link DominanceComparator} and {@code Comparator<Solution>}
 * interfaces.  Since both of these interfaces provide identical {@code int compare(Solution, Solution)} methods, you
 * may encounter a compilation error indicating the use of the {@code compare} method is ambiguous.  This is the result
 * of an important distinction between {@code DominanceComparator} and {@code Comparator<Solution>}.
 * {@link DominanceComparator} induces a <i>partial</i> ordering while {@code Comparator<Solution>} provides a
 * <i>total</i> ordering.  In general, the two can not be interchanged except in cases where the
 * {@code DominanceComparator} produces a total ordering, which is the case here.  However, you will need to cast to
 * one of these two interfaces in order to invoke the {@code compare} method and avoid the compilation error.
