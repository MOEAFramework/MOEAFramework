/**
 * Compares solutions based on a computed aggregate fitness from the objective
 * values.  Examples could include weighted linear, weighted min-max, or
 * vector angle distance scaling (VADS).
 * <p>
 * Implementation Note: This interface extends both the
 * {@link DominanceComparator} and {@code Comparator<Solution>} interfaces.
 * Since both of these interfaces provide identical
 * {@code int compare(Solution, Solution)} methods, you may encounter a
 * compilation error indicating the use of the {@code compare} method is
 * ambiguous.  This is the result of an important distinction between
 * {@code DominanceComparator} and {@code Comparator<Solution>}.
 * {@link DominanceComparator} induces a <emph>partial</emph> ordering while
 * {@code Comparator<Solution>} provides a <emph>total</emph> ordering.  In
 * general, the two can not be interchanged except in cases where the
 * {@code DominanceComparator} produces a total ordering, which is the case
 * here.  However, you will need to cast to one of these two interfaces in order
 * to invoke the {@code compare} method and avoid the compilation error.
