/**
 * Abstract class providing default implementations for several
 * {@link Algorithm} methods.
 * <p>
 * When creating a new subclass, one should:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Use the {@link #evaluate} or {@link #evaluateAll} methods
 *       provided by this class. Do not call {@link Problem#evaluate}
 *       directly as that will not count the number of function evaluations
 *       correctly.
 *   <li>When possible, prefer evaluating all solutions at once by calling
 *       {@link #evaluateAll}. Doing so allows function evaluations to run
 *       in parallel when enabled (see {@code Executor#distributeOnAllCores()}).
 *   <li>Implement the algorithm by overriding the {@link #initialize()} and
 *       {@link #iterate()} methods.
 * </ol>
