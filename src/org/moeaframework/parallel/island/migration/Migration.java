/**
 * A migration strategy for an island model.  Since each island can execute in separate threads or processes, be
 * mindful of thread safety.
 * <p>
 * Migrations execute in the same thread as the current island.  Therefore, you can freely read and write to the
 * current population without synchronization.
 * <p>
 * Each island has a thread-safe immigration queue.  This stores the migrants that are arriving to the current island.
 * Therefore, avoid reading or writing to any neighboring islands directly, use their immigration queue!
 * <p>
 * The migration code should also create copies of migrating solutions.  By convention, this should be done when
 * adding the solution to an immigration queue.  This is especially important when running in a shared memory
 * environment (threaded).
