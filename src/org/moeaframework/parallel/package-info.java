/**
 * Provides island model and other parallelization strategies for optimization algorithms.
 * 
 * "Parallel" in this context can also mean running multiple optimization algorithms together in some fashion.
 * That does not necessarily mean these are "parallel" in the computing sense, where work is distributed across
 * multiple cores or machines.  They can and do support such parallelization, but that typically requires integrating
 * with a third-party compute fabric library like Apache Spark or Apache Ignite.
