/**
 * Construct a variation operator applying one or more variations sequentially.  This construct is used to support
 * mixed-type decision variables; however, this requires that the variation operators are type safe. Type safe
 * variation operates only on supported types and ignores unsupported types.
 * <p>
 * {@code CompoundVariation} provides the following behavior:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If the previous operator produced {@code K} offspring and the current operator requires {@code K} parents,
 *       the current operator is applied normally. The current operator may produce any number of offspring.
 *   <li>If the previous operator produced {@code K} offspring and the current operator requires {@code 1} parent,
 *       the current operator is applied to each offspring individually. The current operator may produce any number of
 *       offspring, but only the first offspring will be retained.
 *   <li>Otherwise, an exception is thrown.
 * </ol>
