 * Deterministic tournament selection operator. The tournament size specifies
 * the number of candidate solutions selected randomly from a population. The
 * winner of a tournament is the best solution in the pool. Unlike probabilistic
 * tournament selection, the best solution is always returned in deterministic
 * tournament selection. If two or more solutions are the best in the pool, one
 * solution is randomly selected with equal probability as the tournament
 * winner.
 * <p>
 * Binary tournament selection exhibits the same selection pressure as linear
 * ranking but without the computational overhead required for ranking. Larger
 * tournament sizes result in greedier selection. Solutions are selected with
 * replacement.
