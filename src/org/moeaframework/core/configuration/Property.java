/**
 * Annotation added to setter methods that identify auto-configurable properties.  The methods must follow
 * JavaBean conventions.  For a property named {@code foo}, then we expected to see the methods:
 * <pre>
 *    public void setFoo(T value) { ... }
 *    public T getFoo() { ... }
 * </pre>
 * The following types are supported:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Any Java primitive type (int, double, boolean, etc.)
 *   <li>{@code String}
 *   <li>Any enumeration - the properties are automatically converted to strings
 *   <li>{@code Variation} - the instance is created using {@code OperatorFactory.getInstance().getVariation(value)}
 *   <li>{@code Mutation} - same as {@code Variation} except only supports one parent
 * </ul>
 * If the type is {@code boolean}, then the getter can alternatively be named {@code isFoo}.
