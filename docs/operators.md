# List of Variation Operators

## Overview

This page details mutation and crossover operators built into the MOEA Framework.  For problems with a single decision variable type, a default operator is
automatically selected.  For problems with mixed types, you will need to explicitly set the operators.  Do this by setting the `operator` parameter:

```java

NondominatedPopulation results = new Executor()
    .withProblem("UF1")
    .withAlgorithm("NSGA-II")
    .withProperty("populationSize", 250)
    .withProperty("operator", "sbx+pm")
    .withProperty("sbx.rate", 0.9)
    .withProperty("sbx.distributionIndex", 20.0)
    .withMaxEvaluations(10000)
    .run();
```

Note that the operator above is in fact the combination of a crossover (`sbx`) and a mutation (`pm`) operator.  Many operators can be combined in this way
by joining them with the `+` symbol.  

## Real-Valued Operators

Real-valued decision variable store floating-point numbers ranging from $\pm \inf$.

### Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX)

SBX attempts to simulate the offspring distribution of binary-encoded single-point crossover on real-valued decision variables [^deb94].  It accepts two parents and produces two offspring.  An example of this distribution, which favors offspring nearer to the two parents, is shown below. 

![SBX](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/SBX-1.png)

The distribution index controls the shape of the offspring distribution. Larger values for the distribution index generates offspring closer to the parents. 

Parameter               | Default Value     | Description
:---------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`sbx.rate`              | `1.0`             | The probability that the SBX operator is applied to a decision variable
`sbx.distributionIndex` | `15.0`            | The shape of the offspring distribution

### Polynomial Mutation (PM)

PM attempts to simulate the offspring distribution of binary-encoded bit-flip mutation on real-valued decision variables [^deb96]. Similar to SBX, PM favors offspring nearer to the parent.  It is recommended each decision variable is mutated with a probability of $1 / N$, where $N$ is the number of decision variables. This results in one mutation per offspring on average. 

The distribution index controls the shape of the offspring distribution. Larger values for the distribution index generates offspring closer to the parents.

Parameter              | Default Value     | Description
:--------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`pm.rate               | `1/N`             | The probability that the PM operator is applied to a decision variable
`pm.distributionIndex` | `20.0`            | The shape of the offspring distribution (larger values produce offspring closer to the parent)

### Differential Evolution (DE)

Differential evolution works by randomly selecting three distinct individuals from a population. A difference vector is calculated between the first two individuals (shown as the left-most arrow in the figure below), which is subsequently applied to the third individual (shown as the right-most arrow in the figure below). 

![DE](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/DifferentialEvolution-1.png)

The scaling factor parameter adjusts the magnitude of the difference vector, allowing the user to decrease or increase the magnitude in relation to the actual difference between the individuals \citep{storn97}. The crossover rate parameter controls the fraction of decision variables which are modified by the DE operator. 

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`de.crossoverRate`   | `0.1`             | The fraction of decision variables modified by the DE operator
`de.stepSize`        | `0.5`             | The scaling factor or step size used to adjust the length of each step taken by the DE operator

### Parent Centric Crossover (PCX)

PCX is a multiparent operator, allowing a user-defined number of parents and offspring [^deb02d]. Offspring are clustered around the parents, as depicted in the figure below.

![SBX](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/PCX-1.png)

`pcx.eta`            | `0.1`             | The standard deviation of the normal distribution controlling the spread of solutions in the direction of the selected parent
`pcx.zeta`           | `0.1`             | The standard deviation of the normal distribution controlling the spread of solutions in the directions defined by the remaining parents

### Unimodal Distribution Crossover (UNDX)

UNDX is a multiparent operator, allowing a user-defined number of parents and offspring [^kita99] [^deb02]. Offspring are centered around the centroid, forming a normal distribution whose shape is controlled by the positions of the parents, as depicted in the figure below.

![SBX](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/UNDX-1.png)

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`undx.parents`       | `10`              | The number of parents
`undx.offspring`     | `2`               | The number of offspring generated by UNDX
`undx.zeta`          | `0.5`             | The standard deviation of the normal distribution controlling the spread of solutions in the orthogonal directions defined by the parents
`undx.eta`           | `0.35`            | The standard deviation of the normal distribution controlling the spread of solutions in the remaining orthogonal directions not defined by the parents. This value is divided by $\sqrt{N}$ prior to use, where $N$ is the number of decision variables

### Simplex Crossover (SPX)

SPX is a multiparent operator, allowing a user-defined number of parents and offspring [^tsutsui99] [^higuchi00]. The parents form a convex hull, called a simplex. Offspring are generated uniformly at random from within the simplex. The expansion rate parameter can be used to expand the size of the simplex beyond the bounds of the parents. For example, the figure below shows three parent points and the offspring distribution, clearly filling an expanded triangular simplex. 

![SBX](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/SPX-1.png)

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`spx.parents`        | `10`              | The number of parents
`spx.offspring`      | `2`               | The number of offspring generated by UNDX
`spx.epsilon`        | `3`               | The expansion rate

### Uniform Mutation (UM)

Each decision variable is mutated by selecting a new value within its bounds uniformly at random. The figure below depicts the offspring distribution. It is recommended each decision variable is mutated with a probability of $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of decision variables. This results in one mutation per offspring on average. 

![SBX](/src/org/moeaframework/core/operator/real/doc-files/UM-1.png)

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`um.rate`            | `1/N`             | The probability that the UM operator is applied to a decision variable

### Adaptive Metropolis (AM)

AM is a multiparent operator, allowing a user-defined number of parents and offspring [^vrugt07] [^vrugt09]. AM produces normally-distributed clusters around each parent, where the shape of the distribution is controlled by the covariance of the parents.

Internally, the Cholesky decomposition is used to update the resulting offspring distribution. Cholesky decomposition requires that its input be positive definite. In order to guarantee this condition is satisfied, all parents must be unique. In the event that the positive definite condition is not satisifed, no offspring are produced and an empty array is returned by 

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`am.parents`         | `10`              | The number of parents
`am.offspring`       | `2`               | The number of offspring generated by AM
`am.coefficient`     | `2.4`             | The jump rate coefficient, controlling the standard deviation of the  covariance matrix.  The actual jump rate is calculated as $(am.coefficient / \sqrt{n})^2$
