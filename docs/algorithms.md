## Instantiating an Algorithm

Each algorithm has a collection of parameters (called properties) used to configure specific details, such as their population size, mutation and
crossover rates, etc.  We can create and configure these algorithms by calling their setter methods:

```java

Problem problem = new UF1();

NSGAII algorithm = new NSGAII(problem);
algorithm.setInitialPopulationSize(250);
algorithm.run(10000);

NondominatedPopulation result = algorithm.getResult();
```

Alternatively, we can use the `Executor` class and configure algorithms by setting the properties.  See
[Running Experiments](experiment.md) for more details on using the `Executor`.

```java

NondominatedPopulation results = new Executor()
    .withProblem("UF1")
    .withAlgorithm("NSGA-II")
    .withProperty("populationSize", 250)
    .withMaxEvaluations(10000)
    .run();
```

Many of these algorithms support any decision variable type, and thus the selected mutation and/or crossover operators will depend on the problem
type.  A default operators is used unless explicitly overridden by the `operator` parameter, where supported.  See the [List of Operators](operators.md)
for specifics.

## Multiobjective Optimizers

### CMA-ES

CMA-ES is a sophisticated covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm for real-valued global optimization[^hansen04][^igel07].  CMA-ES produces 
offspring by sampling a distribution formed by a covariance matrix, hence the name, and updating the covariance matrix based on the surviving offspring.
Single and multi-objective variants exist in the literature and both are supported by the MOEA Framework.  

**Algorithm Name:** `"CMA-ES"`  
**Supported Types:** Real  
**Supported Operators:** None (provides its own variation and mutation)

`initialSearchPoint` | Unset         | Initial guess at the starting location (comma-separated values).  If unset, a random initial guess is used

Derived means the default values are calculated from other settings, but can be overridden if explicitly set.  See Igel., C et al. for details.

### DBEA

DBEA, or I-DBEA, is the Improved Decomposition-Based Evolutionary Algorithm.  DBEA uses the same systematic sampling of reference points as NSGA-III,
but utilizes distance along each reference vector to measure convergence and the perpendicular distance to reference vectors to measure diversity
[^asafuddoula15].  DBEA also proposes corner-sort as a means to identify exteme points for normalization.

**Algorithm Name:** `"DBEA"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description

`divisions`          | Problem dependent | The number of divisions
`divisionsInner`     | Unset             | The number of inner divisions when using the two-layer approach
`divisionsOuter`     | Unset             | The number of outer divisions when using the two-layer approach

See the [NSGA-III](#nsga-iii) documentation for details on generating reference vectors and the two-layer approach.

### e-MOEA
$\epsilon$-MOEA is a steady-state MOEA that uses $\epsilon$-dominance archiving to record a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions [^deb03].
The term steady-state means that the algorithm evolves one solution at a time.  This is in contrast to generational algorithms, which evolve the
entire population every iteration.  $\epsilon$-dominance archives are useful since they ensure convergence and diversity throughout search [^laumanns02].
However, the algorithm requires an additional $\epsilon$ parameter which is problem dependent.  The $\epsilon$ parameter controls the granularity or
resolution of the solutions in objective space.  Smaller values produce larger, more dense sets while larger values produce smaller sets.  In general,
the $\epsilon$ values should be chosen to yield a moderately-sized Pareto approximate set.

**Algorithm Name:** `"eMOEA"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------

`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator
`epsilon`            | Problem dependent | The $\epsilon$ values used by the $\epsilon$-dominance archive, which can either be a single value or a comma-separated array

### e-NSGA-II

$\epsilon$-NSGA-II combines the generational search of NSGA-II with the guaranteed convergence provided by an $\epsilon$-dominance archive [^kollat06].  It also features randomized restarts to enhance search and find a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions.  During a random restart, the algorithm empties the current population and fills it with new, randomly-generated solutions.

**Algorithm Name:** `"e-NSGA-II"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`populationSize`     | `100`             | The size of the population
`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator
`epsilon`            | Problem dependent | The $\epsilon$ values used by the $\epsilon$-dominance archive, which can either be a single value or a comma-separated array
`injectionRate`      | `0.25`            | Controls the percentage of the population after a restart this is "injected", or copied, from the $\epsilon$-dominance archive
`windowSize`         | `100`             | Frequency of checking if a randomized restart should be triggered (number of iterations)

`maximumPopulationSize` | `10000`        | The largest possible population size when injecting new solutions after a randomized restart

### GDE3

GDE3 is the third version of the generalized differential evolution algorithm [^kukkonen05].  The name differential evolution comes from how the algorithm
evolves offspring.  It randomly selects three parents.  Next, it computes the difference (the differential) between two of the parents.  Finally, it offsets
the remaining parent by this differential.

**Algorithm Name:** `"GDE3"`  
**Supported Types:** Real  
**Supported Operators:** DE

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description

`de.crossoverRate`   | `0.1`             | The crossover rate for differential evolution
`de.stepSize`        | `0.5`             | Control the size of each step taken by differential evolution

### IBEA

IBEA is a indicator-based MOEA that uses the hypervolume performance indicator as a means to rank solutions [^zitzler04].  Indicator-based algorithms
are based on the idea that a performance indicator, such as hypervolume or additive $\epsilon$-indicator, highlight solutions with desirable qualities.
The primary disadvantage of indicator-based methods is that the calculation of the performance indicator can become computationally expensive, particularly
as the number of objectives increases.

**Algorithm Name:** `"IBEA"`

`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator
`indicator`          | `hypervolume`     | The indicator function - `hypervolume`, `epsilon

### MOEA/D

MOEA/D is a relatively new optimization algorithm based on the concept of decomposing the problem into many single-objective formulations .  Several versions
of MOEA/D exist in the literature.  The most common variant seen in the literature, MOEA/D-DE [^li09], is the default implementation in the MOEA Framework.

An extension to MOEA/D-DE variant called MOEA/D-DRA introduced a utility function that aimed to reduce the amount of "wasted" effort by the algorithm
[^zhang09].  This variant is enabled by setting the `updateUtility` parameter to a non-zero value.

`de.stepSize`        | `0.5`             | Control the size of each step taken by differential evolution
`pm.rate`            | `1/N`             | The mutation rate for polynomial mutation
`pm.distributionIndex` | `20.0`          | The distribution index for polynomial mutation
`neighborhoodSize`   | `0.1`             | The size of the neighborhood used for mating, given as a percentage of the population size
`delta`              | `0.9`             | The probability of mating with an individual from the neighborhood versus the entire population
`eta`                | `0.01`            | The maximum number of spots in the population that an offspring can replace, given as a percentage of the population size
`updateUtility`      | Unset             | The frequency, in generations, at which utility values are updated.  If set, this uses the MOEA/D-DRA variant; if unset, then then MOEA/D-DE variant is used

### MSOPS

MSOPS is the Multiple Single-Objective Pareto Search algorithm [^hughes03].  MSOPS works by enumerating $k$ reference vectors and applying a rank ordering
based on two aggregate functions: weighted min-max and vector angle distance scaling (VADS).  Solutions with higher rankings with respect to both metrics are
preferred.  MSOPS only supports real-valued solutions using differential evolution.

**Algorithm Name:** `"MSOPS"`  
**Supported Types:** Real  
**Supported Operators:** DE

### NSGA-II

NSGA-II is one of the first and most widely used MOEAs [^deb00].  It enhanced it predecessor, NSGA, by introducing fast non-dominated sorting and using
the more computationally efficient crowding distance metric during survival selection.

**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description

`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator
`withReplacement`    | `true`            | Uses binary tournament selection with (`true`) or without (`false`) replacement

### NSGA-III

NSGA-III is the many-objective successor to NSGA-II, using reference points to direct solutions towards a diverse set [^deb14].  The number of reference
points is controlled by the number of objectives and the `divisions` parameter.  For an $M$-objective problem, the number of reference points is:

$$ H = {M+divisions-1 \choose divisions} $$

The authors also propose a two-layer approach for divisions for many-objective problems where an outer and inner division number is specified.  To use the
two-layer approach, replace the `divisions` parameter with `divisionsOuter` and `divisionsInner`.  `divisionsOuter` controls the number of reference points
on the boundary of the objective space; `divisionsInner` controls the number of reference points on the interior of the objective space.  Please refer
to the cited paper for more details.

`divisionsInner`     | Unset             | The number of inner divisions when using the two-layer approach
`divisionsOuter`     | Unset             | The number of outer divisions when using the two-layer approach

### OMOPSO

OMOPSO is a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm that includes an $\epsilon$-dominance archive to discover a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions [^sierra05].  This implementation of OMOPSO differs slightly from the original author's implementation in JMetal due to a discrepancy between the author's code and the paper.  The paper returns the $\epsilon$-dominance archive while the code returns the leaders.  This discrepancy causes a small difference in performance. 

**Algorithm Name:** `"OMOPSO"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** None (provides its own variation and mutation)

`perturbationIndex`  | `0.5`             | Controls the shape of the distribution for uniform and non-uniform mutation
`epsilon`            | Problem dependent | The $\epsilon$ values used by the $\epsilon$-dominance archive

### PAES

PAES is a multiobjective version of evolution strategy [^knowles99].  PAES tends to underperform when compared to other MOEAs, but it is often used as a baseline algorithm for comparisons.  Like PESA-II, PAES uses the adaptive grid archive to maintain a fixed-size archive of solutions.

### Random

The random search algorithm simply randomly generates new solutions uniformly throughout the search space.  It is not intended as an "optimization algorithm" *per se*, but as a way to compare the performance of other MOEAs against random search.  If an optimization algorithm can not beat random search, then continued use of that optimization algorithm should be questioned.

**Algorithm Name:** `"Random"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------

`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator
`epsilon`            | Unset             | The $\epsilon$ values used by the $\epsilon$-dominance archive, which can either be a single value or a comma-separated array (this parameter is optional)

### RSO

The repeated single objectives (RSO) algorithm solves multiobjective problems by running several single-objective optimizers independently with varying weights [^hughes05].  Any of the single-objective optimizers supported by the MOEA Framework can be utilized, and any properties supported by that optimizer can be defined.  RSO is a useful tool for comparing single and multiobjective optimizers.  The maximum number of evaluations is spread evenly across each single-objective instance.

### RVEA

The reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA) has many similarities with NSGA-III, but avoids use of Pareto dominance and uses an angle-penalized distance function for survival selection [^cheng16].  RVEA only works on problems with at least two objectives and can only use genetic operators requiring two parents.

**Algorithm Name:** `"RVEA"`  
**Supported Types:** Any

`adaptFrequency`     | $\texttt{maxEvaluations / (populationSize * 10)}$ | The frequency (in generations) in which the weights are adapted / scaled

See the [NSGA-III](#nsga-iii) documentation for details on generating reference vectors and the two-layer approach.

`k`                  | `1`               | Crowding is based on the distance to the $k$-th nearest neighbor
`operator`           | Problem dependent | The variation (crossover and/or mutation) operator

### VEGA

VEGA is considered the earliest documented MOEA.  While we provide support for VEGA, other MOEAs should be preferred as they exhibit better performance.  VEGA is provided for its historical significance [^schaffer85].

In addition to the multiobjective optimizers listed above, the MOEA Framework supports several single-objective optimizers.  These single-objective optimizers can be used to solve both single and multiobjective problems.  For multiobjective problems, additional properties are supported to scalarize the objectives into a single value.

:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`populationSize`     | `100`             | The size of the population
`method`             | `linear`          | The scalarization method - `linear`, `min-max`
`weights`            | `1.0,1.0,...`     | The scalarization weights

### DE

DE is the standard differential evolution algorithm[^storn97], also known as `DE/rand/1/bin`.  DE only supports real-valued variables using the differential evolution operator.  DE works by calculating the difference between two randomly-selected points and applying that difference to a third point.

**Algorithm Name:** `"DE"`  
**Supported Types:** Real  
**Supported Operators:** DE

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`populationSize`     | `100`             | The size of the population
`method`             | `linear`          | The scalarization method - `linear`, `min-max`
`weights`            | `1.0,1.0,...`     | The scalarization weights
`de.crossoverRate`   | `0.1`             | The crossover rate for differential evolution
`de.stepSize`        | `0.5`             | Control the size of each step taken by differential evolution

### SA

SA is the simulated annealing algorithm.  The algorithm is allowed to select a worse offspring for survival with
decreasing probability over time.  This decreasing probability is controlled by the initial temperature and the
cooling rate.

**Algorithm Name:** `"SA"`  
**Supported Types:** Any  
**Supported Operators:** Any Mutation

Parameter            | Default Value     | Description
:------------------- | :---------------- | :----------
`operator`           | Problem dependent | The mutation operator
`method`             | `linear`          | The scalarization method - `linear`, `min-max`
`weights`            | `1.0,1.0,...`     | The scalarization weights
`initialTemperature` | `1.0`          | The initial temperature
`alpha`              | `0.8`       | The cooling rate
`numberOfIterationsPerTemperature` | `500` | The number of offspring produced per temperature
