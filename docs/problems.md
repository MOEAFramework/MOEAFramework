### BBOB-2016

Contains the 55 bi-objective problems as part of the "bbob-biobj" test suite from the BBOB workshop hosted at GECCO 2016 [^finck15].
These bi-objective problems are formed by combining two single-objective functions.  Additionally, each problem is further customizable
by the dimension (number of decision variables) and instance number (which varies the location of the optimum point).

The MOEA Framework uses a special name format for these problems.  Each single-objective function has a unique name in the form
`bbob_f<N>_i<N>_d<N>` where `f`, `i`, and `d` represent the test function number, instance, and dimension, respectively.  The `<N>` is
replaced by a specific value for each.  For example, `bbob_f1_i2_d5` represents the first BBOB function (the Sphere function), instance `2`, with 
five decision variables.

Next, two of these single-objective functions are combined to get the bi-objective problem name, separating the names by a comma.
For example, `bbob_f1_i2_d5,bbob_f21_i2_d5` would produce the $(f_1, f_{21})$ bi-objective problem with five decision variables.

To recreate the bbob-biobj test suite from the BBOB workshop, we can enumerate the set of problems using:

```java

int[] functions = new int[] { 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21 };
int[] instances = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 };
int[] dimensions = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 };

List<String> bbob_biobj_names = new ArrayList<String>();

for (int i = 0; i < functions.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < functions.length; j++) {
        for (int instance : instances) {
            for (int dimension : dimensions) {
            	bbob_biobj_names.add(String.format("bbob_f%d_i%d_d%d,bbob_f%d_i%d_d%d",
            			functions[i], instance, dimension, functions[j], instance, dimension));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Problems marked with $\dagger$ have maximized objectives.  Since the MOEA Framework only works with minimized objectives, the objective values are negated.

## Special Problem Classes

### Rotated Problems

In many test problems, there is a direct relationship between decision variables and objectives, often to the point where once can tweak each variable
independently to find the optimum.  Any real-valued problem can be rotated in decision variable space to remove this independence and create a linear
relationship between the variables.  This is accomplished by prepending one of the following to the problem name:

* `ROT_` - Rotates all decision variables by 45 degrees
* `ROT(X)_` - Rotates all decision variables by `X` degrees.  Replace `X` with `RAND` to randomly rotated each axis.
* `ROT(K,X)_` - Makes K rotatations along random planes.  Replace `K` with `ALL` to rotate all axes.

For example:

```java
NondominatedPopulation results = new Executor()
    .withProblem("ROT_DTLZ2_2")
    .withAlgorithm("NSGA-II")
    .withProperty("populationSize", 250)
    .withMaxEvaluations(10000)
    .run();
```

### Scripted or External Problems

The MOEA Framework also has the capability to execute problems written in a scripting language (using the appropriate Java plugin) or external, compiled
programs.  Refer to `ScriptedProblem` and `ExternalProblem` for details.
