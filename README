 1. Introduction
-----------------

The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and
experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other
general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm
optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of
algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, ε-MOEA,
GDE3 and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary
to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.

Its key features includes:
  * Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
  * Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
  * Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
  * Modular design for constructing new algorithms from existing components
  * Permissive open source license
  * Fully documented source code
  * Over 1200 test cases to ensure validity

 3. Installation Instructions
------------------------------

The latest version of the MOEA Framework can be downloaded from 
<http://www.moeaframework.org/>.  The MOEA Framework is available in source
code and binary distributions.  Java 6.0 or later is required.  For source code
distributions, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile the code.
For binary distributions, only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is necessary.
Depending on your platform, the JRE or JDK can be obtained from the following
vendors:

  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/>
    * Windows, Linux and Solaris
    
  JRockit JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/jrockit/>
    * Windows, Linux and Solaris
    * May provide better performance and scalability on Intel 32 and 64-bit
      architectures
      
  OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/>
    * Ubuntu 8.04 (or later), Fedora 9 (or later), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 
      openSUSE 11.1, Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 and OpenSolaris
 
  IBM <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/>
    * AIX, Linux and z/OS
    
  Apple <http://developer.apple.com/java/>

The source code can be imported directly into the Eclipse development
environment <http://www.eclipse.org/>.  First, launch Eclipse.  Second, select
the 'Import...' option from the File menu.  In the popup window, ensure the
General > Existing Projects into Workspace item is highlighted and click Next.
Finally, set the root directory to the extracted MOEA Framework source code
folder and click Finish.  The MOEA Framework is now properly configured in
Eclipse.

Alternatively, an Ant build script is provided to automatically compile the 
source code and package the compiled classes in a JAR file.  Ant binaries can 
be obtained from <http://ant.apache.org/>.  As an example, the compiled JAR is
produced with the following command: 

  ant package-binary       (for Unix/Linux)
  ant.bat package-binary   (for Windows)

The MOEA Framework is distributed with all required third-party libraries
located in the lib/ directory.  These libraries must be made accessible to the
JRE in order to compile and run the MOEA Framework and any applications that
import or link to the MOEA Framework.  If imported into Eclipse as described
above, all libraries are automatically accessible.  Otherwise, the libraries
must be specified manually whenever compiling or running the code using one of
the following methods:

  * Specify JARs on classpath (Unix/Linux only)
      java -classpath $(echo lib/*.jar | sed 's/ /:/g'):. <command>
      
  * Specify JARs on classpath with wildcard
      java -classpath ".:lib/*" <command>
    Windows and Cygwin users will need to replace the colon (:) with a
    semi-colon (;).

  * Specify JARs in extension directories
      java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib <command>

The only optional library, JUnit 4, is required for running unit tests.  The
latest version of JUnit 4 can be downloaded from <http://www.junit.org/> and
should be placed in the lib/ folder.  The unit tests themselves are located in
the test/ folder.  Use 'ant -f test.xml' to run the unit tests.
