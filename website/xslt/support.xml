<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>
  The MOEA Framework is not bug-free, nor is any other software application,
  and reporting bugs to developers is the first step towards improving the
  reliability of software.  Critical bugs will often be addressed within days.
  Requests for new features will also be considered.
