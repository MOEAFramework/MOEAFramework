/**
 * In Example 2, we computed the hypervolume and generational distance for a single
 * run.  We can perform more extensive experiments comparing multiple algorithms
 * using multiple repetitions to statistically compare results.
 * 
 * Below, we use the Executor and Analyzer classes to help perform this analysis.
 * The Executor creates and runs each of the algorithms, possibly with multiple
 * repetitions (seeds).  The Analyzer collects the resulting Pareto fronts,
 * computes selected quality indicators, and displays the results.
 * 
 * In this example, we will compare NSGA-II, GDE3, and eMOEA on the UF1 test problem
 * using the Hypervolume indicator.
