introduction.description = <html><h1>Introduction</h1>\
  The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and \
  experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other \
  general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework \
  supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm \
  optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number \
  of algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, \u03B5-MOEA, \
  GDE3 and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools \
  necessary to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test \
  optimization algorithms.\
  <p>\
  This demo application provides a number of examples to demonstrate the \
  capabilities of the MOEA Framework.  You can run an example by selecting its \
  name to the left and clicking the Run Example button.  Each example also \
  provides its source code for you to browse and learn from.\
  <p>\
  Please visit <a href=\"http://www.moeaframework.org\">\
  http://www.moeaframework.org</a> to get the latest updates and information \
  on the MOEA Framework.
  
example1.name = Example 1
example1.description = <html><h1>Example 1 - Simple Run</h1>\
  The MOEA Framework aims to simply the process of solving multiobjective \
  optimization problems using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). \
  Here, we create the UF1 test problem, solve it using NSGA-II, and display \
  the resulting Pareto front. The algorithm is automatically configured with \
  recommended parameters and operators for the given problem. \
  <p>\
  See the <code>Example1.java</code> tab to view the source code for this example, \
  or click the 'Run Example' button below to run this example.\
  <p>\
  When finished, the output will display the Pareto front.  That is, each row in the \
  output corresponds to a solution and each is Pareto optimal (or Pareto efficient) \
  respect to all other solutions.
				
example2.name = Example 2
example2.description = <html><h1>Example 2 - Statistical Comparisons</h1>\
  The MOEA Framework provides a standardized approach for comparing optimization \
  algorithms.  This capability is provided by the Executor and Analyzer.\
  <p>\
  The Executor is responsible for configuring and running named algorithms for \
  multiple seeds.  By default, it configures each algorithm using their recommended \
  parameters, but these parameters can also be customized (not shown).\
  <p>\
  The Analyzer collects the results from each run, computes performance indicators, \
  and displays the results.  In addition to providing the min, median, and max values \
  for the selected performance indicators, it can also check if any observed differences \
  are statistically significant using the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test.\
  <p>\
  In this example, we compare three algorithms (NSGA-II, GDE3, and \
  \u03B5-MOEA) using the hypervolume metric.  See the \
  <code>Example2.java</code> tab to walk through the source code.  Click the \
  Run Example button to run this example.  It may take several minutes for the \
  output to appear.
  
example3.name = Example 3
example3.description = <html><h1>Example 3 - Collecting Runtime Dynamics</h1>\
  Runtime dynamics provide insight into the behavior of an optimization \
  algorithm throughout a run. For instance, one can observe how solution \
  quality changes with the number of function evaluations (NFE). The \
  Instrumenter class records the runtime dynamics.\
  <p>\
  In this example, we will observe how the generational distance metric \
  converges to 0 as NSGA-II solves the UF1 problem.  See the \
  <code>Example3.java</code> tab to walk through the source code.  Click the \
  Run Example button to run this example.  It may take several minutes for the \
  output to appear.
  
example4.name = Example 4
example4.description = <html><h1>Example 4 - Defining New Problems</h1>\
  This example demonstrates how to define a new optimization problem, specifically \
  we will create the two-objective Srinivas test problem. The<code>Example4.java</code> \
  tab shows how we create the <code>Srinivas</code> class and define three methods:\
  <ol>\
    <li>the constructor,\
    <li>the <code>newSolution</code> method, and\
    <li>the <code>evaluate</code> method.\
  </ol>\
  Inside the constructor, we simply call <code>super(2, 2, 2);</code> to specify \
  this problem has two decision variables, two objectives, and two constraints. \
  The <code>newSolution</code> method defines the problem representation (the number \
  and types of its decision variables). The <code>evaluate</code> method takes a \
  solution and computes its objective function values.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button to run this example.  Similar to Example 1, the \
  output will list all of the Pareto optimal solutions.
  
regression1.name = Symbolic Regression - Function 1
regression1.description = <html><h1>Symbolic Regression - Function 1</h1>\
  Symbolic regression attempts to discover a mathematical expression that best \
  fits a curve.  In this example, we will attempt to find an equation to mimic \
  the function <code>f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x</code>.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button below to run this example.  You will see the \
  target function in red and the estimate produced by the MOEA Framework in \
  blue.
  
regression2.name = Symbolic Regression - Function 2
regression2.description = <html><h1>Symbolic Regression - Function 2</h1>\
  Symbolic regression attempts to discover a mathematical expression that best \
  fits a curve.  In this example, we will attempt to find an equation to mimic \
  the function <code>f(x) = x^5 - 2x^3 + x</code>.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button below to run this example.  You will see the \
  target function in red and the estimate produced by the MOEA Framework in \
  blue.
  
regression3.name = Symbolic Regression - Function 3
regression3.description = <html><h1>Symbolic Regression - Function 3</h1>\
  Symbolic regression attempts to discover a mathematical expression that best \
  fits a curve.  In this example, we will attempt to find an equation to mimic \
  the function <code>f(x) = x^6 - 2x^4 + x^2</code>.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button below to run this example.  You will see the \
  target function in red and the estimate produced by the MOEA Framework in \
  blue.
  
lotz.name = LOTZ Problem
lotz.description = <html><h1>Leading Ones, Trailing Zeros (LOTZ) Problem</h1>\
  The LOTZ problem is one of the canonical examples for bit string (binary) \
  problems.  The goal of this problem is an enumeration of bit strings that \
  begin with some number of 1 bits (leading ones), and the remaining bits are \
  0 (trailing zeros).  So, for example, the LOTZ solutions for a 4-bit example \
  are:\
  <pre>    1111\n    1110\n    1100\n    1000\n    0000</pre>\
  The first line has four leading ones and no trailing zeros, the second has \
  three leading ones and one trailing zero, and so on.\
  <p>\
  In this example, we will solve the LOTZ problem with 10 bits. \
  You can view the source code for setting up this example in the \
  <code>LOTZExample.java</code> tab.  Note that when we use the Executor to \
  run this problem, we do not need to specify that this problem uses a binary \
  encoding.  Rather, the MOEA Framework automatically determines the \
  representation and chooses the appropriate recombination and mutation \
  operators for the representation.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button to run this example.  The output should contain \
  11 rows with varing numbers of leading ones and trailing zeros.  The two \
  numbers at the end of each row indicate the number of ones and zeros, \
  respectively, in the solution.
  
onemax.name = One-Max Problem
onemax.description = <html><h1>One-Max Problem</h1>\
  The one-max problem is another canonical example for bit string (binary) \
  problems.  The goal of this problem is to maximize the number of 1's in the \
  bit string.  While the solution to this problem is trivial (all bits set to \
  1), the one-max problem is commonly used to measure the convergence speed of \
  an algorithm.  In other words, how many function evaluations are needed to \
  find the optimal solution to this problem?  For this example, we will \
  determine how many function evaluations are needed for the one-max problem \
  with 100 bits.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button to run this example.
  
knapsack.name = Knapsack Problem
knapsack.description = <html><h1>Knapsack Problem</h1>\
  The knapsack problem is a famous combinatorial problem that involves \
  choosing which items to place in a knapsack to maximize the value of the \
  items carried without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.  See \
  the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem\">Wikipedia \
  article</a> for details.\
  <p>\
  In this example, we will be solving a multiobjective variant of the knapsack \
  problem.  For this example, we need to pick which items (100 available) to \
  place into two sacks.  Each sack assigns its own weight and profit to each \
  item.  See the tab <code>knapsack.100.2</code> to see the weights and \
  profits for each item.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button below to run this example.  When it finishes, \
  the screen will show all optimal solutions to this problem.  Since this is a \
  multiobjective problem, there will be more than one optimal solution.  The \
  binary string indicates which items are included in the sack (1) and which \
  are excluded (0).
  
ant1.name = Ant Problem - Santa Fe
ant1.description = <html><h1>Ant Problem - Santa Fe Trail</h1>\
  The ant problem defines a world containing food at certain positions, and \
  aims to design a robotic ant to navigate through the world and eat the food. \
  This robotic ant is controlled by a program consisting of several \
  operations:\
  <ol>\
    <li>if-else condition,\
    <li>turn left,\
    <li>turn right,\
    <li>move forward, and\
    <li>check if food is ahead.\
  </ol>\
  Using the MOEA Framework's genetic programming capability, we can encode \
  these operations as operators in a programming language, and evolve the \
  program to search the world for food.\
  <p>\
  See the tabs for details on implementing the ant problem in the MOEA \
  Framework.  In particular, the <code>santafe.trail</code> tab shows the \
  position of food (#).  The full source code for this problem can be found in \
  the <code>examples/org/moeaframework/examples/gp/ant</code> directory.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button below to run this example.  When it finishes, \
  it will print out the world showing the food eaten (@) and the uneaten food \
  (#).
  
ant2.name = Ant Problem - Los Altos
ant2.description = <html><h1>Ant Problem - Los Altos Trail</h1>\
  The Los Altos trail is a harder variant of the ant problem.  The food is \
  dispersed along a more complex trail, and a more complex program is needed \
  to control the ant.\
  <p>\
  Click the Run Example button to run this example.  It may take several \
  minutes for the output to appear.
  
tsp1.name = Traveling Salesman Problem - PR76
tsp1.description = <html><h1>Traveling Salesman Problem - PR76 Instance</h1>\
  The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a famous combinatorial optimization \
  problem.  The traveling salesman must visit every city on a map but has one \
  restriction: she can only visit a city once.  Since fuel costs money, she \
  wants to find a route between all the cities that minimizes the total \
  distance traveled.  Additional details can be found on the <a \
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem\">\Wikipedia \
  page</a>.\
  <p>\
  In this example, we will attempt to solve <code>pr76.tsp</code>, a 76 city \
  map developed by Manfred Padberg and Giovanni Rinaldi, two famous TSP \
  researchers.  This problem instance and more are available \
  <a href=\"http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/\">here</a>. \
  Start the optimization by clicking the Run Example button.  The GUI will \
  show the best path discovered by the MOEA Framework in red.  The lighter \
  gray lines show alternative paths being searched by the MOEA Framework. \
  The optimal tour has a length of 108159.\
  <p>\
  <i>Note: This example uses the open source \
  <a href=\"https://github.com/dhadka/TSPLIB4J\">TSPLIB4J library</a>.
  
tsp2.name = Traveling Salesman Problem - A280
tsp2.description = <html><h1>Traveling Salesman Problem - A280 Instance</h1>\
  This example attempts to solve a harder TSP instance, <code>a280.tsp</code>. \
  This instance has 280 cities.  Click the Run Example button below and see \
  how long it takes to find the optimal tour of length 2579.\
  <p>\
  <i>Note: This example uses the open source \
  <a href=\"https://github.com/dhadka/TSPLIB4J\">TSPLIB4J library</a>.
  
parallelization.name = Multi-threaded Parallelization
parallelization.description = <html><h1>Multi-threaded Parallelization</h1>\
  When function evaluations are computationally expensive, we can speed up \
  algorithms by distributing work across multiple cores or machines.  This is \
  powered by Java's <code>ExecutorService</code> interface, and can work with \
  any distributed computing library supporting this interface.\
  <p>\
  This example will compare a serial run versus a multi-threaded version that \
  distributed evaluations on all available cores.
  
island.name = Island Model Parallelization
island.description = <html><h1>Island Model Parallelization</h1>\
  Another way to parallelize MOEAs is using the island model, where we create multiple \
  independent optimization algorithms that run in parallel, i.e., on "islands". \
  Each island utilizes its own algorithm and population, but periodic migration events \
  move solutions between islands.  This allows results from one island to influence others. \
  <p>\
  In this example, we will solve the UF1 problem using a standalone NSGA-II instance \
  and compare it against an 8 island version.  Where the standalone version runs for \
  10,000 function evaluations, each island will only get 1,250 evaluations (so the total \
  evaluations summed across all islands is also 10,000).  But we should see the island \
  model actually produces a better result!\
  <p>\
  Click Run Example to run this example and display the resulting Pareto sets.

diagnostic.name = Diagnostic Tool
diagnostic.description = <html><h1>Diagnostic Tool</h1>\
  The MOEA Framework provides several built-in optimization algorithms along \
  with many test problems.  The diagnostic tool is a GUI for solving these \
  test problems using the available optimization algorithms.  The GUI will \
  appear when you click the Run Example button.  Use the drop-down menus in \
  the upper-left portion of the window to select which algorithm and problem \
  the use.  Then click Run to solve the problem.  The various performance \
  metrics are available for plotting.  You can select the metrics from the \
  list in the lower-left portion of the window.

conclusion.name = Conclusion
conclusion.description = <html><h1>Conclusion</h1>\
