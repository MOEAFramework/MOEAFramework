/**
 * Demonstrates how problems can be defined externally to the MOEA Framework.
 * This is useful in many scenarios, including when the problem:
 * 
 * 1. is already written in another programming language (C/C++, Python, etc.),
 * 2. is computationally expensive and benefits from compilation, or
 * 3. uses functionality not available in Java (GPU acceleration, etc.).
 * 
 * One way to achieve this is to invoke the executable from within the problem's
 * evaluation function.  This works fine when the overhead of starting a new process
 * is minimal.
 * 
 * For cases where startup is expensive, the MOEA Framework can stream all evaluations
 * to a single process by passing the inputs and reading the outputs from either the
 * standard input/output streams or over network sockets.  This example demonstrates
 * standard input/output.
 * 
 * To help setup such programs, we have provided a C library used to receive the inputs
 * sent from the MOEA Framework and write the responses (objectives and constraints) back.
 * See {@code moeaframework.c} and {@code moeaframework.h} in the {@code examples/} folder.
 * The {@code dtlz2.c} program demonstrates how to use this library.
 * 
 * To run this example, first compile the C program by running the {@code make} command
 * in the {@code ./examples/} folder.  Then, run this Java example.
