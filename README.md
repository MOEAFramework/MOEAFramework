The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and
experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other
general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm
optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of
algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, ε-MOEA,
GDE3, PAES, PESA2, SPEA2, IBEA, SMS-EMOA, SMPSO, OMOPSO, CMA-ES, and MOEA/D.
In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary
to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.

Its key features includes:
  * Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
  * Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
  * Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
  * Tools for building and statistically testing new optimization algorithms
  * [Professional support for businesses](http://moeaframework.org/support.html)
  * Permissive open source license
  * Fully documented and tested source code

Since its initial release in 2011, the MOEA Framework has been downloaded over
38,000 times, averaging over 900 downloads per month this past year.  Please
