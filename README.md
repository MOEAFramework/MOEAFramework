The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and experimenting with multiobjective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other metaheuristics.


### Features

* Fast, reliable implementations of over 25 MOEAs, including NSGA-III and MOEA/D.
* Suite of tools for comparing and statistically testing algorithms.
* Master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization.
* Permissive open source license (LGPL)

### Getting Started

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework/releases) page.  Maven users can add our
dependency to their `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.moeaframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>moeaframework</artifactId>
    <version>5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Check out our [examples](https://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework/tree/master/examples),
[online documentation](https://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework/blob/master/docs/README.md), and
[API Specification (Javadoc)](https://moeaframework.org/javadoc/index.html) to get started.


### Example

Below we solve the 2-objective DTLZ2 problem using NSGA-II:

<!-- java:examples/Example1.java [29:34] -->

```java
Problem problem = new DTLZ2(2);

NSGAII algorithm = new NSGAII(problem);
algorithm.run(10000);

algorithm.getResult().display();
```
